Hey guys, Today's challenge is BAM FILE COMPARASION

<h2> THE PROBLEM
Your task is to find each gene that's been deleted in each sample (i.e > 90% of positions in that gene have coverege of <5 read) 
and report the gene names in file to the user </h2>

Tools that U have to install:

http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeUwRepliSeq
http://www.htslib.org/doc/#howtos


and U'll need a Bam file to convert a txt file 

You can use that file on the repo
